# ElectionSimulator
> A simple, yet modular election simulator, because politicians don't know how to do proper math.

I asked my girlfriend for a project idea for [Hack Club's Summer of Making](https://summer.hackclub.com/),
and she ended up almost begging for an election simulator web app. So here we are now. Say thanks to her
for this, I guess. :3
